"An entry can be tagged by moving the scroll bar to it and pressing\n"
"@BOLD{Space Bar}.\n"
"\n"
"Pressing @BOLD{ESCAPE} or @BOLD{`} exits the phone book and returns to @BOLD{TERMINAL Mode}.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{Phone Book Dialing}\n"
"\n"
"  Two commands are available to dial or connect: @BOLD{M}anual Dial and @BOLD{Enter}.\n"
"\n"
"  If no entries are tagged, then pressing @BOLD{Enter} will connect to the\n"
"  highlighted entry.\n"
"\n"
"  If at least one entry is tagged, then pressing @BOLD{Enter} will move the scroll\n"
"  bar to the next entry and attempt to connect, trying each tagged entry\n"
"  until a successful connection is established.\n"
"\n"
"  @BOLD{M}anual Dial brings up a dialog to enter a phone number and immediately\n"
"  begin dialing.  Manual dialing is only supported for modem connections.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{Phone Book Commands}\n"
"\n"
"  The following commands operate on the phone book as a whole:\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{F} Find Text\n"
"\n"
"    This brings up a dialog to enter a search string.  Enter the string\n"
"    and press @BOLD{Enter}, and Qodem will move the scroll bar to the first entry\n"
"    that matches the search string.  The fields checked for a match are the\n"
"    name, address, and notes.  If the match occurs in the notes, a popup\n"
"    message is displayed to indicate that the match was in the notes.  A\n"
"    popup is also display if the text is not found at all.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{A} Find Again\n"
"\n"
"    This is nearly identical to @BOLD{F}ind, however it will continue searching\n"
"    for a match from the current scroll bar location onward.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{L} Load\n"
"\n"
"    This brings up a directory view to load a different phone book file\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{O} Other Info\n"
"\n"
"    This changes the visible columns.  There are five different views\n"
"    available, between them all most of the fields can be seen in tabular\n"
"    form.  Passwords in the password field are replaced by asterisks (@BOLD{*}).\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{^P/P} Print 132/80\n"
"\n"
"    This brings up a dialog to select a printer to output the phone book to.\n"
"    The default value sends the phone book to the system printer.  Entering\n"
"    a different value will print the phone book to a file.  @BOLD{^P} selects 132-\n"
"    column format, @BOLD{P} selects 80-column format.  THIS COMMAND EXPOSES\n"

"    purpose undo feature.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{Phone Book Entry Commands}\n"
"\n"
"  The following commands operate on the highlighted or tagged entry:\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{Space Bar} Tag/Untag\n"
"\n"
"    This tags (or untags) the highlighted entry.  If the entry has a\n"
"    script file associated with it and the file does not exist, then\n"
"    tagging it will also enable QuickLearn.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{I-Ins} Insert New Entry\n"
"\n"
"    This inserts a new entry and switches to the Revise Entry screen.\n"
"    The new entry is inserted before the highlighted entry.  Both @BOLD{I} and\n"
"    @BOLD{Insert} will work.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{^D/D-Del} Delete Tagged/Bar\n"
"\n"
"    This deletes either the highlighted entry only (@BOLD{D} or @BOLD{Delete}) or all\n"
"    tagged entries (@BOLD{^D}).  A prompt is displayed to select either the notes\n"
"    only or the entire entry.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{^R/R} Revise Tagged/Bar\n"
"\n"
"    This brings up either the highlighted entry only (@BOLD{R}) or all tagged\n"
"    entries (@BOLD{^R}) in the phone book revise entry form.  After editing, the\n"
"    changes can be saved by pressing @BOLD{F10} to return to the phone book, or\n"
"    abandoned by pressing @BOLD{ESCAPE}.  If multiple entries were selected to be\n"
"    edited with @BOLD{^R}, then each tagged entry will be brought up in the edit\n"
"    window in sequence.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{T} Tag Multiple\n"
"\n"
"    This brings up an entry box to tag multiple entries.  Entries can be\n"
"    tagged in two ways, each tag separated by space:\n"
"        1. By entry number.\n"
"        2. By text search: precede with the letter @BOLD{T} or @BOLD{t}.\n"
"    Examples:\n"
"        1. To select entries 1, 5, and 16, enter the tag string \"1 5 16\".\n"
"        2. To select entries that match \"web\", enter the tag string\n"
"           \"Tweb\".\n"
"        3. To select entries that match \"bbs\" and also entries 10 and 23,\n"
"           enter the tag string \"Tbbs 10 23\".\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{U} Untag All\n"
"\n"
"    This untags all tagged entries.\n"
"\n"
"    @BOLD{Q} QuickLearn\n"
"\n"
"    This flags the highlighted entry for QuickLearn.  The entry must have a\n"
"    script associated with it.  That script will be overwritten with a new\n"
"    script the next time the entry is connected.\n"

"@TOPIC{REFERENCE_98_VERSIONS,Reference - Differences Between Text, X11, and Win32 Versions}\n"
"@BOLD{Qodem} comes in three flavors:\n"
"\n"
"  @BOLD{Text}  - The text version is a typical Unix-like curses-based\n"
"          application.  It can be run on the raw Linux console,\n"
"          inside an X11-based terminal emulator, or under Mac\n"
"          OS X Terminal.app.  This version will look different\n"
"          depending on what fonts are supplied with the end-user\n"
"          terminal.\n"
"\n"
"  @BOLD{X11}   - The X11 version is a native X11-based application.\n"
"          It provides its own font to look consistent on all systems.\n"
"\n"
"  @BOLD{Win32} - The Win32 version is a native Windows-based application\n"
"          that runs on most Win32-based systems including Windows 2000, XP\n"
"          Vista, and Windows 7.\n"
"\n"
" @BOLD{Text Version Notes}\n"
"\n"
" Compiling Qodem from source will build the text version by default.\n"
"\n"
" @BOLD{X11 Version Notes}\n"
"\n"
" The X11 version can be activated by passing --enable-x11 to configure.\n"
" Due to how the curses libraries are linked, a single qodem binary\n"
" cannot currently support both interfaces.  The X11 binary is built\n"
" as 'qodem-x11', and its man page is accessed by 'man qodem-x11'.\n"
"\n"

"Qodem does not have its own scripting language.  Instead, any\n"
"program that reads and writes to the standard input and output can\n"
"be run as a Qodem script:\n"
"\n"
"  * Characters sent from the remote connection are visible to the\n"
"    script in its standard input.\n"
"\n"
"  * Characters the script emits to its standard output are passed on\n"
"    the remote connection.\n"
"\n"
"  * Messages to the standard error are reported to the user and also\n"
"    recorded in the session log.\n"
"\n"
"Since scripts are communicating with the remote system and not Qodem\n"
"itself, they are unable to script Qodem's behavior, e.g. change the\n"
"terminal emulation, hangup and dial another phone book entry,\n"
"download a file, etc.  However, they can be written in any language,\n"
"and they can be tested outside Qodem.\n"
"\n"
"Scripts replace the user, and as such have similar constraints:\n"
"\n"
"  * Script standard input, output, and error must all be in UTF-8\n"
"    encoding.\n"
"\n"
"  * Scripts should send carriage return (0x0D, or \\r) instead of new\n"
"    line (0x0A, or \\n) to the remote side - the same as if a user\n"
"    pressed the Enter key.  They should expect to see either bare\n"
"    carriage return (0x0D, or \\r) or carriage return followed by\n"
"    newline (0x0D 0x0A, or \\r\\n) from the remote side.\n"
"\n"
"  * Input and output translate byte translation (the @BOLD{Alt-A} Translate\n"
"    Tables) are honored for scripts.\n"
"\n"
"  * While a script is running:\n"
"        - Zmodem and Kermit autostart are disabled.\n"
"        - Keyboard function key macros are disabled.\n"
"        - Qodem functions accessed through the @BOLD{Alt-}character\n"
"          combinations and PgUp/PgDn are unavailable.\n"
"        - Pressing @BOLD{Alt-P} will pause the script.\n"
"\n"
"  * While a script is paused:\n"
"        - The script will receive nothing on its standard input.\n"
"        - Anything in the script's standard output will be held\n"
"          until the script is resumed.\n"
"        - The script process will not be signaled; it may continue\n"
"          running in its own process.\n"
"        - The only @BOLD{Alt-}character function recognized is @BOLD{Alt-P} to\n"
"          resume the script.  All other @BOLD{Alt-} keys will be ignored.\n"
"        - Keys pressed will be sent directly to the remote system.\n"

"\n"
"  * In TERMINAL mode, press @BOLD{Alt-F} and enter the script filename.\n"
"    The script will start immediately.\n"
"\n"
"  * In the phone book, add a script filename to a phone book entry.\n"
"    The script will start once that entry is connected.\n"
"\n"

"    Unicode INPUT table.  Code points read from the keyboard are\n"
"    converted through the Unicode OUTPUT table before being converted\n"
"    to UTF-8.\n"
"\n"
"  * When using 8-bit codepages, Qodem attempts to convert code points\n"
"    read from the keyboard back to the correct 8-bit codepage value\n"
"    based on several strategies.  If no values can be found, @BOLD{?} is\n"
"    sent instead.\n"
"\n"
"  * Capture, scrollback, screen dump, and keyboard macro files are\n"
"    stored in untranslated formats where possible.  \'raw\' capture\n"
"    records bytes before the 8-bit tables are applied; \'normal\'\n"
"    capture and other files record code points after 8-bit tables are\n"
"    applied but before Unicode tables are applied.\n"
"\n"

"\n"
"ANSI emulation supports more codes than ANSI.SYS.  Specifically, it\n"
"responds to DSR 6 (Cursor Position) which many BBSes used to\n"
"\"autodetect\" ANSI, and it also supports the following ANSI X3.64\n"

"\n"
"Qodem supports two kinds of DOORWAY mode: \"Doorway FULL\" and\n"
"\"Doorway MIXED\".  \"Doorway FULL\" matches the behavior of\n"
"Qmodem's DOORWAY mode.  \"Doorway MIXED\" behaves like DOORWAY\n"
"EXCEPT for a list of commands to honor.  These commands are stored\n"
"in the qodemrc 'doorway_mixed_mode_commands' option.  \"Doorway\n"
"MIXED\" allows one to use @BOLD{PgUp}/@BOLD{PgDn} and @BOLD{Alt-X} (M-X) in Emacs yet\n"

"Qodem includes a Alt Code Key function (@BOLD{Alt-\\}) for entering a raw\n"
"decimal byte value (0-255) or a 16-bit Unicode value (0-FFFF).\n"
"\n"
"Capture, screen dump, and saving scrollback can be saved in several\n"
"formats (configured in qodemrc).  \"normal\" behaves like Qmodem:\n"
"colors and emulation commands are stripped out, leaving a UTF-8\n"
"encoded black-and-white text file.  \"html\" saves in an HTML format\n"
"that includes colors.  For capture only, \"raw\" saves the raw\n"
"incoming byte stream before any UTF-8 decoding or emulation\n"
"processing.  For all save formats, \"ask\" will bring up a dialog to\n"
"select the save format every time the save is requested.  For\n"
"phone book entries that specify a capture file, if the capture type\n"
"is \"ask\" it will be saved in \"normal\" format.\n"
"\n"
"Host mode behaves differently.  It uses simple ASCII menus rather\n"
"than CP437 menus, provides no \"Optional Activities\", and has fewer\n"
"features than Qmodem's Host Mode implementation.  However, in\n"
"addition to listening on the modem, it can also listen on TCP ports\n"
"for raw socket, telnet, and ssh connections; optionally the TCP port\n"
"can be exposed via UPnP to the general Internet.\n"
"\n"
"The @BOLD{Alt-A} Translate Tables behave differently.  Instead of two\n"

"(0x00 - 0x1F, 0x7F) are mapped to the equivalent CP437 glyphs when there\n"
"are no glyphs defined in that range for the set codepage.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{ANSI}    - This is the DOS-based \"ANSI.SYS\" emulation plus a few more codes\n"
"than the original ANSI.SYS.  It supports DSR 6 (Cursor Position) which many\n"
"BBSes used to \"autodetect\" ANSI, and also the following ANSI X3.64\n"
"functions: ICH, DCH, IL, DL, VPA, CHA, CHT, and REP.  It also supports\n"
"\"ANSI Music\" sequences that follow the \"PLAY\" command syntax.  It can play\n"
"these tones either directly on the Linux console using its console beep, or\n"
"the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{AVATAR}  - This is the BBS-era Avatar (\"Advanced Video Attribute Terminal\n"
"Assembler and Recreator\") emulation.  It supports all of the \"Extended\n"
"AVT/0\" commands as per George A. Stanislav's 1 May 1989 document except for\n"
"transmitting PC keyboard scan codes.  It also includes ANSI fallback\n"
"capability.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{VT52}    - This is a fairly complete VT52.  It does not support HOLD SCREEN\n"
"mode.  Since the original specified some graphics mode glyphs that do not\n"
"have direct Unicode equivalents (yet), those characters are rendered as a\n"
"hatch (&#x2592;).\n"

"@BOLD{VT102}   - This is a fairly complete VT102.  The text version displays\n"
"double-width and double-height characters correctly when run under xterm,\n"
"X11, and Win32, but when run on the raw Linux console Qodem displays\n"
"double-width / double-height with a character followed by a space.  Qodem\n"
"also does not support smooth scrolling, printing, keyboard locking, and\n"
"hardware tests.  On the text Qodem build, some numeric keypad characters\n"

"@BOLD{VT220}   - This is fairly complete VT220.  It converts the National\n"
"Replacement Character sets and DEC Supplemental Graphics characters to\n"
"Unicode.  In addition to the limitations of VT102, also the following VT220\n"
"features are not supported: user-defined keys (DECUDK), downloadable fonts\n"
"(DECDLD), VT100/ANSI compatibility mode (DECSCL).\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{TTY}     - This emulation supports bare control character handling\n"
"(backspace, newline, etc.) and litte else.  Characters that would be\n"

"@BOLD{LINUX}   - This emulation has two modes: PC VGA (@BOLD{LINUX}) and UTF-8 (@BOLD{L_UTF8}).\n"
"This emulation is similar to VT102 but also recognizes the Linux private\n"
"mode sequences and ECMA-48 sequences VPA, CNL, CPL, ECH, CHA, VPA, VPR, and\n"
"HPA.  In addition to VT102 limitations, also the following Linux console\n"

"sets, X11 mouse reporting, and setting the scroll/caps/numlock leds.\n"
"\n"
"@BOLD{XTERM}   - This emulation has two modes: PC VGA (@BOLD{XTERM}) and UTF-8 (@BOLD{X_UTF8}).\n"
"It recognizes everything in LINUX, VT220, and a few more XTerm sequences.\n"
"It does not support most of the advanced features unique to XTerm such\n"
