Qodem incorporates some code or other implementation details from the
following people:

  minicom-2.1, Copyright Miquel van Smoorenburg et al

    modem.c:open_serial_port() contains the same access patterns as
    minicom (create UUCP-style lockfile, detect stale lockfile,
    initialize termios)

  Jeff Gustafson - created Fedora RPM build

  Bjoern Hoehrmann - UTF-8 decoding routine

  Free Software Foundation - getopt

  NetBSD - strptime dirname basename

  Mark Martinec - snprintf

Some libraries have very minor changes (primary #ifdef guards) to
enable compilation.  I, Kevin Lamonte, do hereby declare that any
changes and contributions I have made to those libraries are in the
public domain and available to all.

The Borland C++ 5.02 build uses a portable version of snprintf()
written by Mark Martinec, available under the terms of the Frontier
Artistic License.  The copyright and license are reproduced below.

   Mark Martinec <mark.martinec@ijs.si>, April 1999, June 2000
   Copyright Â© 1999, Mark Martinec


The Frontier Artistic License Version 1.0
Derived from the Artistic License at OpenSource.org.
Submitted to OpenSource.org for Open Source Initiative certification.

Preamble

The intent of this document is to state the conditions under which a
Package may be copied, such that the Copyright Holder maintains some
semblance of artistic control over the development of the package,
while giving the users of the package the right to use and distribute
the Package in a more-or-less customary fashion, plus the right to
make reasonable modifications.

Definitions

  "Package" refers to the script, suite, file, or collection of
  scripts, suites, and/or files distributed by the Copyright Holder,
  and to derivatives of that Package created through textual modification.

  "Standard Version" refers to such a Package if it has not been
  modified, or has been modified in accordance with the wishes of
  the Copyright Holder.

  "Copyright Holder" is whoever is named in the copyright statement
  or statements for the package.

  "You" is you, if you're thinking about copying or distributing
  this Package.

  "Reasonable copying fee" is whatever you can justify on the basis
  of media cost, duplication charges, time of people involved, and
  so on. (You will not be required to justify it to the Copyright
  Holder, but only to the computing community at large as a market
  that must bear the fee.)

  "Freely Available" means that no fee is charged for the item
  itself, though there may be fees involved in handling the item.
  It also means that recipients of the item may redistribute it under
  the same conditions they received it.


Terms

1. You may make and give away verbatim copies of the source form of
the Standard Version of this Package without restriction, provided
that you duplicate all of the original copyright notices and
associated disclaimers.

2. You may apply bug fixes, portability fixes, and other modifications
derived from the Public Domain or from the Copyright Holder. A Package
modified in such a way shall still be considered the Standard Version.

3. You may otherwise modify your copy of this Package in any way,
provided that you insert a prominent notice in each changed script,
suite, or file stating how and when you changed that script, suite,
or file, and provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  a) Use the modified Package only within your corporation or
  organization, or retain the modified Package solely for personal use.

  b) Place your modifications in the Public Domain or otherwise make
  them Freely Available, such as by posting said modifications to Usenet
  or an equivalent medium, or placing the modifications on a major archive
  site such as ftp.uu.net, or by allowing the Copyright Holder to include
  your modifications in the Standard Version of the Package.

  c) Rename any non-standard executables so the names do not conflict
  with standard executables, which must also be provided, and provide
  a separate manual page (or equivalent) for each non-standard executable
  that clearly documents how it differs from the Standard Version.

  d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

4. You may distribute the programs of this Package in object code or
executable form, provided that you do at least ONE of the following:

  a) Distribute a Standard Version of the executables and library
  files, together with instructions (in the manual page or
  equivalent) on where to get the Standard Version.

  b) Accompany the distribution with the machine-readable source of
  the Package with your modifications.

  c) Accompany any non-standard executables with their corresponding
  Standard Version executables, give the non-standard executables
  non-standard names, and clearly document the differences in manual
  pages (or equivalent), together with instructions on where to get
  the Standard Version.

  d) Make other distribution arrangements with the Copyright Holder.

5. You may charge a reasonable copying fee for any distribution of
this Package. You may charge any fee you choose for support of this
Package. You may not charge a fee for this Package itself. However,
you may distribute this Package in aggregate with other (possibly
commercial) programs as part of a larger (possibly commercial)
software distribution provided that you do not advertise this Package
as a product of your own.

6. The scripts and library files supplied as input to or produced as
output from the programs of this Package do not automatically fall
under the copyright of this Package, but belong to whomever generated
them, and may be sold commercially, and may be aggregated with this
Package.

7. Scripts, suites, or programs supplied by you that depend on or
otherwise make use of this Package shall not be considered part of
this Package.

8. The name of the Copyright Holder may not be used to endorse or
promote products derived from this software without specific prior
written permission.

9. THIS PACKAGE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND WITHOUT ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, WITHOUT LIMITATION, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
MERCHANTIBILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.

                        The End

Qodem is linked to the cryptlib library by Peter Gutmann.  cryptlib is
available from its home page at:
https://www.cs.auckland.ac.nz/~pgut001/cryptlib/ or
http://www.cryptlib.com/, and version 3.4.3beta is also included in
the qodem github repository.  cryptlib's license terms are reproduced
below:

This file contains the usage terms for cryptlib.  The full details of cryptlib
usage are provided on the cryptlib home page; although this file and the
information on the web page should be identical, in case of any dispute the
web page takes precedence.  This file is included because some distributions
require the presence of a COPYING file.

cryptlib is distributed under a dual license that allows free, open-source use
under a GPL-compatible license and closed-source use under a standard
commercial license.  The GPL-compatible license (a.k.a. the Sleepycat license)
is given below.  Further details on this license are available from the
cryptlib home page.

  Copyright 1992-2013 Peter Gutmann. All rights reserved.

  Redistribution and use in source and binary forms, with or without
  modification, are permitted provided that the following conditions are met:

  1. Redistributions of source code must retain the above copyright notice, this
     list of conditions and the following disclaimer.

  2. Redistributions in binary form must reproduce the above copyright notice,
     this list of conditions and the following disclaimer in the documentation
     and/or other materials provided with the distribution.

  3. Redistributions in any form must be accompanied by information on how to
     obtain complete source code for the cryptlib software and any accompanying
     software that uses the cryptlib software.  The source code must either be
     included in the distribution or be available for no more than the cost of
     distribution, and must be freely redistributable under reasonable
     conditions.  For an executable file, complete source code means the source
     code for all modules it contains or uses.  It does not include source code
     for modules or files that typically accompany the major components of the
     operating system on which the executable file runs.  Note that decoupling
     the software from the user, for example by running in a SaaS configuration,
     does not exempt you from these requirements.

  THIS SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED "AS IS" AND ANY EXPRESS OR IMPLIED
  WARRANTIES, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF
  MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE, OR
  NON-INFRINGEMENT, ARE DISCLAIMED.  IN NO EVENT SHALL THE AUTHOR BE
  LIABLE FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, EXEMPLARY, OR
  CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, PROCUREMENT OF
  SUBSTITUTE GOODS OR SERVICES; LOSS OF USE, DATA, OR PROFITS; OR
  BUSINESS INTERRUPTION) HOWEVER CAUSED AND ON ANY THEORY OF
  LIABILITY, WHETHER IN CONTRACT, STRICT LIABILITY, OR TORT (INCLUDING
  NEGLIGENCE OR OTHERWISE) ARISING IN ANY WAY OUT OF THE USE OF THIS
  SOFTWARE, EVEN IF ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGE.

If you're unable to comply with the above license then the following,
alternate usage conditions apply:

  Any large-scale commercial use of cryptlib requires a license.  "Large-scale
  commercial use" means any revenue-generating purpose such as use for
  company-internal purposes, or use of cryptlib in an application or product,
  with a total gross revenue of over US$5,000.  This allows cryptlib to be
  used in freeware and shareware applications, for evaluation and research
  purposes, and for non-revenue-generating or personal use without charge.  In
  addition the author reserves the right to grant free licenses for commercial
  use in special cases (for example where there is a general benefit to the
  public), contact the author for details if you think you qualify.
