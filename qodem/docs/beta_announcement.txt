Qodem 1.0beta Release
=====================

I am pleased to announce the release of Qodem 1.0beta.

This marks the culmination of 13 years of development with the goal of
re-creating one of the very best DOS-era modem terminals into the
Internet era for use on modern systems.  Its major features include:

  * Many ways to connect to a system: ssh, telnet, rlogin, raw socket,
    dialing a modem, using a serial port, or executing a local shell.

  * Support for BBS-era and modern emulations: ANSI.SYS (including
    "ANSI music"), Avatar, VT52, VT100/102, VT220, Linux (+ UTF-8),
    and XTerm (+ UTF-8 and mouse tracking).  The VT100, Linux, and
    Xterm-based emulations have been run through the gauntlet of
    'vttest'.

  * A Unicode-based display, including translation of DOS and Windows
    8-bit character sets (CP437, CP850, Windows 1252, and many more),
    the VT100 DEC Special Graphics characters, and the VT220 National
    Replacement Character sets to Unicode.

  * The classic serial file transfer protocols Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem,
    and Kermit.

  * Terminal interface conveniences including a long scrollback
    buffer, capture file, screen dump, dialing directory, and keyboard
    macros.

  * External script support.  ANY program that reads stdin and writes
    to stdout and stderr can be run as a script.

  * A host mode that provides a micro-BBS with messages, files, and
    sysop chat.  In addition to answering a modem call, it can also
    listen on a raw socket, act as a telnet or ssh daemon, and even
    use UPnP to work seamlessly behind a home NAT router.
