Qodem 1.0.0 Final Release
=========================

I am pleased to announce the release of Qodem 1.0.0.

This marks the culmination of 14 years of development with the goal of
re-creating one of the very best DOS-era modem terminals into the
Internet era for use on modern systems.  Its major features include:

  * Many ways to connect to a system: ssh, telnet, rlogin, raw socket,
    dialing a modem, using a serial port, or executing a local shell.

  * Support for many BBS-era and modern emulations: ANSI.SYS
    (including "ANSI music"), Avatar, VT52, VT100/102, VT220, Linux (+
    UTF-8), XTerm (+ UTF-8 and mouse tracking), ATASCII (Atari), and
    PETSCII (Commodore).  The VT100, Linux, and Xterm-based emulations
    have been run through the gauntlet of 'vttest'.  ATASCII and
    PETSCII support 40-column display.

  * A Unicode-based display, including translation of DOS and Windows
    8-bit character sets (CP437, CP850, Windows 1252, and many more),
    the VT100 DEC Special Graphics characters, and the VT220 National
    Replacement Character sets to Unicode.

  * The classic serial file transfer protocols Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem,
    and Kermit.

  * Terminal interface conveniences including a long scrollback
    buffer, capture file, screen dump, dialing directory, and keyboard
    macros.

  * External script support.  ANY program that reads stdin and writes
    to stdout and stderr can be run as a script.

  * A host mode that provides a micro-BBS with messages, files, and
    sysop chat.  In addition to answering a modem call, it can also
    listen on a raw socket, act as a telnet or ssh daemon, and even
    use UPnP to work seamlessly behind a home NAT router.

The source code to Qodem was dedicated to the public domain on May 26,
2015, with a CC-0 fallback license for those jurisdictions that do not
recognize the public domain.  Due to inclusion of other pieces in the
binary releases, the binary versions of Qodem have an effective

whether or not cryptlib is included.  See the README file for further
details.


Related Projects
----------------

The development of Qodem has led to two spinoff projects:

* Jexer: a Java-based text windowing system strongly resembling the
  Turbo Vision library.  Jexer features mouse support, menu bar,
  draggable/resizable windows, modal dialog boxes, and more.  It also
  includes its own terminal emulator derived from Qodem's VT100/Xterm
  emulation, which is good enough to pass vttest.

* Jermit: a Java re-implementation of the classic serial file transfer
  protocols.  Xmodem and Ymodem are working already, Kermit and Zmodem
  are in the works.  https://github.com/klamonte/jermit

Both projects are undergoing a slow-paced development effort, hoping
to reach completion in the next 1-2 years.
