.SH DESCRIPTION
.I Qodem
is an open\-source clone implementation of the popular DOS\-based
Qmodem serial communications program.  Qodem incorporates many
features that are useful on several kinds of text\-based consoles such
as scrollback buffer, session capture, screen dump, dialing directory,
and also includes serial port handling and modem dialing.

The major features of Qodem are:

  * Unicode display: translation of CP437 (PC VGA), VT100 DEC Special
    Graphics characters, VT220 National Replacement Character sets,
    etc., to Unicode

  * Terminal interface conveniences: scrollback buffer, capture file,
    screen dump, dialing directory, keyboard macros, script support

  * Connection methods: serial, local shell, command line, telnet,
    ssh, rlogin, raw socket

  * Emulations: ANSI, Avatar, VT52, VT100/102, VT220, Linux, XTerm,
    PETSCII (Commodore), and ATASCII (Atari).

  * Transfer protocols: Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem, and Kermit

.SH TERMINAL REQUIREMENTS

Qodem requires the following characteristics of its shell/terminal:

  * Unicode capability.  The raw Linux console, UXTerm, URxvt,
    Konsole, and gnome-terminal all work well.

  * A Unicode font that includes the CP437 (PC VGA) glyphs.

  * The meta key must use escape prefixing rather than setting the 8th
    bit on the character.  Many terminal emulators do this by
    default.  Qodem sends an xterm escape sequence to enable this
    behavior.  For XTerm, this can be enabled by clicking
    CTRL\-Mouse1 (left button) and checking "Meta Sends Escape", or by
    adding the following lines to ~/.Xresources:
.br
        XTerm*metaSendsEscape:   true
.br
        UXTerm*metaSendsEscape:  true

.SH CONNECTION METHODS

Qodem supports the following connection methods:

.TP
.B
MODEM
Calls the remote system by dialing a phone number.
.TP
.B
LOCAL
Spawns a local shell in a pseudo-tty.
.TP
.B
RLOGIN
Connects to the remote system using the rlogin protocol.  Qodem can
either spawn an executable to connect (e.g. 'rlogin') or use its own
networking code.  Its own networking code will only run successfully
if Qodem is running as root, due to the need to bind to a privileged
port.  See the
.B rlogin
and
.B use_external_rlogin
options in
.B qodemrc.
.TP
.B
SSH
Connects to the remote system using the ssh protocol.  Qodem can
either spawn an executable to connect (e.g. 'ssh') or use its own
networking code.  See the
.B ssh
and
.B use_external_ssh
options in
.B qodemrc.
.TP
.B
TELNET
Connects to the remote system using the telnet protocol.  Qodem can
either spawn an executable to connect (e.g. 'telnet') or use its own
networking code.  See the
.B telnet
and
.B use_external_telnet
options in
.B qodemrc.
.TP
.B
SOCKET
Connects to the remote system using a raw TCP socket.
.TP
.B
CMDLINE
Spawns the command line in a pseudo-tty.

.SH EMULATIONS

Emulations supported by Qodem and their status follows.  Note that
TTY, DEBUG, ANSI.SYS, AVATAR, LINUX, and XTERM emulations can be set
to CP437 (DOS VGA), ISO\-8859\-1, CP720 (DOS Arabic), CP737 (DOS
Greek), CP775 (DOS Baltic Rim), CP850 (DOS West European), CP852 (DOS
Central European), CP857 (DOS Turkish), CP858 (DOS West
European+Euro), CP860 (DOS Portuguese), CP862 (DOS Hebrew), CP863 (DOS
Quebecois), CP866 (DOS Cyrillic), Windows\-1250 (Central/East
European), Windows\-1251 (Cyrillic), Windows\-1252 (West European),
KOI8\-R (Russian), and KOI8\-U (Ukrainian).

When 8\-bit characters are used (see Alt\-; Codepage below), the C0
control characters (0x00 \- 0x1F, 0x7F) are mapped to the equivalent
CP437 glyphs when there are no glyphs defined in that range for the
set codepage.

.TP
.B
ANSI
This is the DOS\-based "ANSI.SYS" emulation plus a few more codes than
the original ANSI.SYS.  It supports DSR 6 (Cursor Position) which many
BBSes used to "autodetect" ANSI, and the following ANSI X3.64
functions: ICH, DCH, IL, DL, VPA, CHA, CHT, and REP.  It also supports
"ANSI Music" sequences that follow the "PLAY" command syntax;  it
plays these tones via SDL.
.TP
.B
AVATAR
This is the BBS\-era Avatar ("Advanced Video Attribute Terminal
Assembler and Recreator") emulation.  It supports all of the "Extended
AVT/0" commands as per George A. Stanislav's 1 May 1989 document
except for transmitting PC keyboard scan codes.  It also includes ANSI
fallback capability.
.TP
.B
VT52
Fairly complete.  Does not support HOLD SCREEN mode.  Graphics mode
glyphs that do not have direct Unicode equivalents render as a hatch.
.TP
.B
VT100
Identical to VT102 except in how it responds to Device Attributes
function.
.TP
.B
VT102
Fairly complete.  Does not support smooth scrolling, printing,
keyboard locking, and hardware tests.  Many numeric keypad characters
also do not work correctly due to console NUM LOCK handling.
132\-column output is only supported if the host console / window is
already 132 columns or wider; Qodem does
.B not
issue resize commands to the host console for 80/132 column switching
codes.
.TP
.B
VT220
Fairly complete.  Converts National Replacement Character sets and DEC
Supplemental Graphics characters to Unicode.  In addition to
limitations of VT102, also the following features are not supported:
user\-defined keys (DECUDK), downloadable fonts (DECDLD), VT100/ANSI
compatibility mode (DECSCL).
.TP
.B
TTY
This emulation supports bare control character handling (backspace,
newline, etc.) and litte else.  Characters that would be overwritten
with underscores are instead made underlined as old teletypes would
do.
.TP
.B
DEBUG
This emulation displays all incoming characters in a format similar to
a hex dump.
.TP
.B
LINUX
This emulation has two modes: PC VGA (LINUX) and UTF\-8 (L_UTF8).
This emulation is similar to VT102 but also recognizes the Linux
private mode sequences and ECMA\-48 sequences VPA, CNL, CPL, ECH, CHA,
VPA, VPR, and HPA.  In addition to VT102 limitations, also the
following features are not supported: selecting ISO 646/ISO
8859\-1/UTF\-8 character sets, X11 mouse reporting, and setting the
scroll/caps/numlock leds.
.TP
.B
XTERM
This emulation has two modes: PC VGA (XTERM) and UTF\-8 (X_UTF8).  It
recognizes everything in LINUX, VT220, and a few more XTerm sequences.
It does not support most of the advanced features unique to XTerm such
as Tektronix 4014 mode, alternate screen buffer, and many more.  It is
intended to support XTerm applications that only use the sequences in
the 'xterm' terminfo entry.
.TP
.B
PETSCII
This very loosely emulates a 40-column Commodore 64/128.  Colors are
not quite right due to the IBM CGA colors being unable to match the
Commodore colors.  Uppercase/lowercase affect new characters rather
than the whole screen.  This emulation requires the C64 Pro Mono font
from Style, available at http://style64.org/c64-truetype/ .  (Note
that this font is only licensed to software packages that are "freely
provided to end users".  Entities wishing to ship packages that are
not "freely provided to end users" will need to either remove this
font, or negotiate a separate license agreement by contacting Style at
http://style64.org/contact-style .)
.TP
.B
ATASCII
This emulates the 8-bit Atari 400/800 series.

.SH "FILE TRANSFER PROTOCOLS"
Protocols supported by Qodem and their status follows:
.TP
.B
XMODEM
Supports original Xmodem, Xmodem\-1k, Xmodem\-CRC16, and Xmodem\-G.  Also
supports "Xmodem Relaxed", a variant of original Xmodem with longer
timeouts.
.TP
.B
YMODEM
Supports Ymodem and Ymodem\-G.  If a file exists, it will be appended to.
.TP
.B
ZMODEM
Supports resume (crash recovery) and auto\-start.  Does not yet support
changing block size on errors, so transfers over unreliable
serial/modem connections might incur significant performance
penalties.
.TP
.B
KERMIT
Supports the original robust (slow) Kermit plus streaming, sliding
windows, and autostart.  On reliable connections with streaming it
should perform reasonably well.  Does not yet support long or
extra\-long packets, RESEND/REGET, or server mode.

.SH INTERFACE
.B Phone Book
.br
When Qodem first starts up, by default it will start in the phone
book.  The menu on the bottom half of the screen lists the various
actions available.  When editing a phone book entry, the status line
will change to show options for each field.  Connecting to a system or
leaving the phone book puts Qodem in Terminal Mode.

.B Terminal Mode
.br
Terminal Mode is the main Qodem terminal emulator interface.
.B Alt\-Z
will bring up a help menu.  While in Terminal Mode the following
actions are supported:
.TP
.B Alt\-D Phone Book
This brings up the phone book.
.TP
.B Alt\-G Term Emulation
This brings up a menu to select the terminal emulation.  Selecting the
active terminal emulation will prompt to reset the emulation state;
this may be useful to recover from corrupted escape sequences.
.TP
.B Alt\-C Clear Screen
This clears the screen and homes the cursor.
.TP
.B Alt\-F Execute Script
This prompts for a filename, and then executes that file as a script.
Any program that reads from standard input and writes to standard
output can be run as a script.  See the section below on script
support.
.TP
.B Alt\-K Send BREAK
When connected via serial mode or modem, this calls tcsendbreak() to
send a true "Break Signal" on the serial line.
.TP
.B Alt\-P Capture File
Enable/disable capture to file.  Four capture formats are supported:
"raw", "normal", "html", and "ask".  "Raw" format saves every byte as
received from the other side before emulation processing; "normal"
saves UTF\-8 characters after emulation processing; "html" saves in
HTML format with Unicode entities and color attributes after emulation
processing; "ask" will bring up a dialog to select which format to use
every time capture is enabled.  ASCII file transfers will be included
in the capture file; other file transfers (Xmodem, Ymodem, Zmodem,
Kermit) are excluded from the capture file.
.TP
.B Alt\-S Split Screen
This actives split screen mode, in which local characters are
accumulated in a buffer before sending to the remote side.  To send
carriage return, enter "^M".
.TP
.B Alt\-T Screen Dump
This prompts for a filename, and then saves the current view to that
file.  Three screen dump formats are supported: "normal", "html", and
"ask".  "normal" saves UTF\-8 characters after emulation processing;
"html" saves in HTML format with Unicode entities and color attributes
after emulation processing; "ask" will bring up a dialog to select
which format to use every time the screen is dumped.
.TP
.B Alt\-Y COM Parameters
This brings up a menu to alter the serial port settings.
.TP
.B PgUp Upload Files
This brings up the file upload menu.  Note that CTRL\-PgUp and ALT\-PgUp
may also work depending on the terminfo for the host terminal.
.TP
.B PgDn Download Files
This brings up the file download menu.  Note that CTRL\-PgDn and
ALT\-PgDn may also work depending on the terminfo for the host
terminal.
.TP
.B Alt\-\\\\ Alt Code Key
This brings up a dialog to enter the 3\-digit decimal value (0\-255) for
an 8\-bit byte or a 4\-digit hexadecimal value (0\-ffff) for a 16\-bit
Unicode character (L_UTF8 and X_UTF8 only).
.TP
.B Alt\-; Codepage
This brings up a dialog to change the current codepage.  Codepages are
limited by the current emulation.  VT52, VT100, VT102, VT220, L_UTF8,
X_UTF8, PETSCII, and ATASCII have their own codepage; LINUX, XTERM, ANSI,
AVATAR, TTY, and DEBUG emulations can be set to: CP437 (VGA),
ISO\-8859\-1, CP720 (Arabic), CP737 (Greek), CP775 (Baltic Rim), CP850
(Western European), CP852 (Central European), CP857 (Turkish), CP858
(Western European with euro), CP860 (Portuguese), CP862 (Hebrew),
CP863 (Quebec French), CP866 (Cyrillic), CP1250 (Central/Eastern
European), CP1251 (Cyrillic), CP1252 (Western European), KOI8_R
(Russian),and KOI8_U (Ukrainian).
.TP
.B Alt\-/ Scroll Back
This selects the scrollback buffer.  When viewing the buffer, "S"
saves to file and "C" clears the scrollback buffer.  By default Qodem
supports up to 20000 lines of scrollback; this can be changed by
editing scrollback_max in scrollback.c.  Three scrollback save formats
are supported: "normal", "html", and "ask".  "normal" saves UTF\-8
characters after emulation processing; "html" saves in HTML format
with Unicode entities and color attributes after emulation processing;
"ask" will bring up a dialog to select which format to use every time
the scrollback is saved.
.TP
.B Alt\-H Hangup/Close
This hangs up the modem (drops DTR) or closes the remote connection
(kills the child process).
.TP
.B Alt\-L Log View
This brings the session log up in an editor.  The session log stores
information about connect, disconnect, and file upload/download
events.
.TP
.B Alt\-M Mail Reader
This spawns the mail reader, by default
.BR mm "."
.TP
.B Alt\-X Exit Qodem
This prompts to exit Qodem.  When not connected, Ctrl\-C will also
bring up the exit prompt.
.TP
.B Alt\-A Translate Tables
This brings up the translate tables editor.  Both incoming and
outgoing bytes can be changed or stripped (set to ASCII NUL (0)).
Note that 8-bit INPUT translation occurs before both emulation
processing and UTF\-8 decoding.  Unicode INPUT translation occurs
before code points are written to the scrollback buffer; Unicode
OUTPUT translation occurs after code points are read from the
keyboard.
.TP
.B Alt\-J Function Keys
This brings up the keyboard macro editor.  Keyboard macros support
substitutions for control characters including carriage return ("^M"),
the phone book entry username ("$USERNAME"), and the phone book entry
password ("$PASSWORD").
.TP
.B Alt\-N Configuration
This brings the
.B qodemrc
options file up in an editor.
.TP
.B Alt\-: Colors
This brings the
.B colors.cfg
colors file up in an editor.
.TP
.B Alt\-O Modem Config
This brings up the modem configuration dialog.
.TP
.B Alt\-R OS Shell
This spawns a system shell.
.TP
.B Alt\-V View File
This brings up a prompt to view a file in an editor.
.TP
.B Alt\-W List Directory
This brings up a directory listing.
.TP
.B Alt\-0 Session Log
This toggles the session log on or off.
.TP
.B Alt\-1 XON/XOFF Flow Ctrl
When connected via modem or serial port, this toggles XON/XOFF on or off.
.TP
.B Alt\-2 Backspace/Del Mode
This selects whether the backspace key on the keyboard sends an ASCII
backspace (^H) or an ASCII DEL (127) character.  Alt\-\\ 0 0 8 can always be
used to send true backspace; Alt\-\\ 1 2 7 can be used to send true DEL.
Note that VT220 emulation always sends DEL when the backspace key is
pressed.
.TP
.B Alt\-3 Line Wrap
This toggles line wrap mode on or off.  When line wrap mode is
enabled, if a character is received when the cursor is at the right
margin it will wrap to the first column of the next line.
.TP
.B Alt\-4 Display NULL
This selects whether ASCII NUL (0) will be displayed as a blank/space
or stripped.
.TP
.B Alt\-5 Host Mode
This switches Qodem into Host Mode.
.TP
.B Alt\-6 Batch Entry Window
This brings up the list of upload files used by Ymodem, Zmodem, and
Kermit uploads.
.TP
.B Alt\-7 Status Line Info
This selects between two formats for the status line.
.TP
.B Alt\-8 Hi\-Bit Strip
This selects whether or not to clear the 8th bit of all incoming
bytes.  Note that high\-bit stripping occurs before both emulation
processing and UTF\-8 decoding.
.TP
.B Alt\-9 Serial Port
This opens or closes the serial port.  If already connected to a
non\-serial/modem remote host, this does nothing.
.TP
.B Alt\-B Beeps & Bells
This toggles beep support on or off.  When beep support is on, beeps
from the remote host will be played by Qodem.  In LINUX emulation,
Qodem supports setting the tone and duration of the beep as specified
in
.BR console\-codes "(4)."
.TP
.B Alt\-E Half/Full Duplex
This toggles between half and full duplex.
.TP
.B Alt\-I Qodem Information
This displays the Qodem splash screen which includes the version and
build date.
.TP
.B Alt\-U Scrollback Record
This selects whether or not lines that scroll off the top of the
screen will be saved to the scrollback buffer.
.TP
.B Alt\-= Doorway Mode
This selects between three doorway modes: "Doorway OFF", "Doorway
MIXED" and "Doorway FULL".  When doorway mode is "Doorway OFF",
terminal mode responds to all of its command keys as described in this
section.  When doorway mode is "Doorway FULL", all Alt\- command
keystrokes except
.B Alt\-=
are passed to the remote side.  When doorway mode is "Doorway MIXED",
terminal mode supports a few commands but passes the majority of Alt\-
command keystrokes to the remote side.  The default commands supported
in "Doorway MIXED" mode are:
     Alt\-D Phone Book
     Alt\-P Capture
     Alt\-T Screen Dump
     Alt\-Y COM Parameters
     Alt\-Z Menu
     Alt\-/ Scrollback
     Alt\-PgUp or Ctrl\-PgUp Upload Files
     Alt\-PgDn or Ctrl\-PgDn Download Files
.TP
.B Alt\-\- Status Lines
This toggles the status line on or off.
.TP
.B Alt\-+ CR/CRLF Mode
This toggles whether or not received carriage returns imply line feed
or not.
.TP
.B Alt\-, ANSI Music
This toggles ANSI music support on or off.

.SH UNICODE SUPPORT

Qodem supports Unicode (UTF\-8 encoding only) in the following
functions only: keyboard macros; phone book entries (NAME, USERNAME,
and PASSWORD); modem device name.

UTF\-8 is NOT supported in filenames, modem strings, and remote
addresses.

.SH SCRIPT SUPPORT

Qodem does not have its own scripting language.  Instead, any program
that reads and writes to the standard input and output can be run as a
Qodem script:

    * Characters sent from the remote connection are visible to the
      script in its standard input.

    * Characters the script emits to its standard output are passed on
      the remote connection.

    * Messages to the standard error are reported to the user and also
      recorded in the session log.

Since scripts are communicating with the remote system and not Qodem
itself, they are unable to script Qodem's behavior, e.g. change the
terminal emulation, hangup and dial another phone book entry, download
a file, etc.  However, they can be written in any language, and they
can be tested outside Qodem.

Scripts replace the user, and as such have similar constraints:

  * Script standard input, output, and error must all be in UTF\-8 encoding.

  * Scripts should send carriage return (0x0D, or \\r) instead of new
    line (0x0A, or \\n) to the remote side \- the same as if a user
    pressed the Enter key.  They should expect to see either bare
    carriage return (0x0D, or \\r) or carriage return followed by
    newline (0x0D 0x0A, or \\r\\n) from the remote side.

  * Input and output translate byte translation (the Alt\-A Translate Tables) are honored for scripts.

  * While a script is running:
        \- Zmodem and Kermit autostart are disabled.
        \- Keyboard function key macros are disabled.
        \- Qodem functions accessed through the Alt\-character
          combinations and PgUp/PgDn are unavailable.
        \- Pressing Alt\-P will pause the script.

  * While a script is paused:
        \- The script will receive nothing on its standard input.
        \- Anything in the script's standard output will be held until
          the script is resumed.
        \- The script process will not be signaled; it may continue
          running in its own process.
        \- The only Alt\-character function recognized is Alt\P to
          resume the script.  All other Alt\- keys will be ignored.
        \- Keys pressed will be sent directly to the remote system.
        \- Keyboard function key macros will work.

Scripts are launched in two ways:

  * In TERMINAL mode, press Alt\-F and enter the script filename.  The
    script will start immediately.

  * In the phone book, add a script filename to a phone book entry.
    The script will start once that entry is connected.

Script command\-line arguments can be passed directly in both the
Alt\-F script dialog and the phone book linked script field.  For
example, pressing Alt\-F and entering "my_script.pl arg1" will launch
my_script.pl and with its first command\-line argument ($ARGV[0] in
Perl) set to "arg1".

.SH ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
.TP
Qodem makes use of the following variables:
.TP
.B HOME
The user's home directory.  Qodem creates two directories:
.BR "$HOME/.qodem" " for qodem's internal files (phone book, keyboard macro files, translate tables, etc.) and " "$HOME/qodem" " for uploaded and downloaded files, session log, capture, etc."
.TP
.B EDITOR
If present, this will be used when spawning external editors (log
view, edit configuration, view file, edit phone book note).  If not
present, by default (editable in the options file) use
.BR vi "."
.TP
.B ESCDELAY
This is a timeout value in milliseconds used by the ncurses
