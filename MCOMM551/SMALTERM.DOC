               SMALTERM.C -- Demo comm program for async routines

         ===============================================================

            Smalterm is a demo program written using the routines in the
         COMM_S library to demonstrate the library functions.  The C
         version does not have any file transfer protocols built in,
         however, the SND.BAT and RCV.BAT files are set up to call
         Forsberg's DSZ external Zmodem protocol and are executed by
         pressing PGUP or PGDN.  The C++ version does include XMODEM and
         XMODEM-1K protocols.

            It contains code for a host mode (host mode only in C
         version) similar to that found in Procomm, a Shell to DOS
         function, receive with timeout, hang-up, remote prompt for user
         input, and some other useful functions.

            To build the program you need to have the header files that
         come in the archive and the COMM_S.LIB to link with.  If you
         use Turbo C or Zortech C, you will also need to convert the
         COMM_S lib to your format by running TCLIBS.BAT or ZTCLIBS.BAT.
         Once you have the correct LIBs and .H files in your INCLUDE and
         LIB directories, compile and link:

            (q)cl smalterm.c /link comm_s         ;Microsoft C
            tcc smalterm.c comm_s.lib             ;Turbo C
            ztc -b smalterm.c comm_s.lib          ;Zortech C

            tcc smalterm.cpp comm.cpp comm_s.lib  ;Turbo C++
            ztc smalterm.cpp comm.cpp comm_s.lib  ;Zortech C++

         To run the program:

            smalterm {COM1 | COM2} {parameters Ex: 2400n81}

            SMALTERM is yours to do what you want with but you may not
         distribute the library source code or the libraries that come
         with the registered version.
